GENERATE NEW OR REVISED DOCUMENTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AND 

SHALL BE RETURNED TO THE ORIGINATOR FOR CORRECTION. 

C. For a new or revised SOP, a new softcopy SOP Template Form 
shall be used (available on the Maintenance share drive); and a 
release/change authority number shall be obtained from MDC 
(processed per SOP GSOP-0006 - “Maintenance Document 
Control Process”).   

1. A unique identification number and/or current revision level 
number shall be assigned to each SOP by MDC and will be 
shown in the designated spaces on page one and in the 
header at the top of each page. 

2. SOPs being revised are required to have an appropriately 
detailed description of what is being revised and why on 
page one, directly below the ‘Initial Release’ connotation.

7.0 PROCEDURE 

7.1 INTRODUCTION 

A. A fuel card management company has been selected to provide 
unleaded regular gasoline to HART NRVs from selected service 
stations using a fuel purchasing card. 

1. Background 

Vehicles are generally operated within, but are not limited to 
the HART service area. HART maintains the NRV fleet, which 
primarily use unleaded regular gasoline. 

2. Scope 

 The purpose of this SOP is to provide the process allowing 
HART to purchase regular grade unleaded gasoline for its NRV 
fleet. A fleet fuel management company purchasing card 
system shall be used for payment of these fuels. Each vehicle 
will have a unique fuel card number assigned. 

7.2 FUEL CARD USE 

A. Card Control 

1. Only regular unleaded gasoline is authorized to be purchased 
with the fuel card. 

2. One fuel card will be issued per vehicle. 

3. The fuel card system now requires a six digit entry for 
employee ID. Key in your employee ID numbers and complete 
the entry using the “0” key,  three digit employee ID add three 
“0” on the end, four digit employee ID add two “0” on the end. 

4. The vehicle’s current odometer reading will be required at the 
pump (ensure you do not enter the trip odometer reading). Do 
not enter 10ths of a mile. 

5. No prepay is permitted. If the pump is down, user is required 
to proceed to another station to fuel. User must notify his/her 
supervisor/manager that the station is having a problem. The 
supervisor/manager will notify the MCP of the problem so they 
can investigate it further. 

6. Users of the cards for fuel cans will enter his/her Payroll 
number and additional “0’’ to complete the six digit 
requirement. Enter “0” for the odometer reading. Write the gas 
can card number on the receipt.

7. All vehicles have a fuel card assigned and the card will be 
signed out and in. 

8. All fuel cans have an assigned card. Usage of fuel is to be for 
small equipment only.  

9. The control person of each department will be responsible for 
the fuel card being signed out and in for both vehicles and fuel 
cans. 

10. Employees are to report lost, stolen or damaged cards 
immediately upon discovery to the CP. 

11. The CP is responsible to notify the MCP of lost, stolen or 
damaged cards. 

12. The cards issued to an employee will be signed out and in with 
the requirements stated on the vehicle log. By signature the 
last person issued the card is responsible for its use and return. 

13. There is a $5.00 replacement fee for lost cards. Written report 
must be completed by the employee who lost the fuel card. 
Report and $5.00 fee will be sent to the MCP. The MCP will 
review and forward both to finance. 

14. A list of approved service stations in the Tampa Bay area will 
be provided to all CP. There are three listings; Tampa, Brandon 
& Tampa 20 mile Area. CP should identify which map each 
vehicle may need and provide with the fuel card. 

15. Employees fueling vehicles are responsible for obtaining a 
receipt of the fuel purchase. 

16. Each division will provide a specific location for the receipts for 
the vehicles they are responsible for within their division. 

17. Receipts should be handed in on the day the vehicle is fueled.  
Do not put the receipt in the blue pouch in the vehicle as this 
will delay processing of the receipt information. 

18. The receipt must contain the following information before 
being handed in:

7.0 PROCEDURE 

A. HART is not responsible for articles left on HART property. However, if an 
article is found and turned in to the proper authority, this procedure will be 
automatically implemented. In the event of any discrepancies, HART will 
investigate each case on an individual basis. 

 
B. HART’S dispatch will only contact operators via radio for the following lost 

articles: wallets/purses, prescriptions/medication, eyeglasses, and keys. 
Drivers are to follow the instructions given by the dispatcher on duty or a 
transit supervisor on how to handle specific articles. Individuals claiming 
any other articles the same day of the incident will be advised to contact 
the marketing representative’s office at the Marion Transit Center (MTC) 
on the next working day after 9:00 a.m. in an attempt to locate and retrieve 
the article. Those articles being transported by a supervisor from 21st 
Avenue to MTC will be delivered the next day; time of delivery may vary 
depending upon priority field responsibilities scheduled/non-scheduled on 
day of delivery. 

C. Articles that will be discarded on the day they are found: 
1. All articles which will spoil such as food products 
2. Any personal hygiene articles such as combs, hairbrushes, used 

shoes, or any other article that can be deemed hazardous to 
human health 

3. Clothing that smells or is soiled 
D. Weapons, firearms, and illegal drugs will be logged then turned over to 

HART’s security department for handling. Security will follow the proper 
procedures for disposal or submission to the proper Authority, such as 
Tampa Police Department or Hillsborough Sheriff’s Office.  

 
E. Articles which are suspected to be hazardous or flammable material, liquid 

or solid, are not retainable by HART; if found on HART property the 
manager of passenger amenities and facilities, facilities maintenance 
coordinator, or a facilities maintenance technician should be contacted 
immediately for proper disposal. 

F. Items found on vehicles at 21st Avenue by Maintenance employees during 
daytime hours Sunday through Saturday, will be turned into the Supervisor 
on duty in the Shop Office. The Shop Supervisor will make a 
determination of value and, depending on value, will place the item either 
in the bin located in the service lane office or deliver it to dispatch as soon 
as possible. During the night shift, after 5:00 PM on Sunday through 
Saturday, items will be turned into the Service Lane Supervisor for 
placement in the lost and found bin or processed as valuable items and 
delivered to dispatch. The Service Lane Supervisor will deliver non-

valuable items collected during the day to dispatch at the end of each 
shift. 

Special Note: Articles of value must be hand delivered to the MTC 
representative by the transit supervisor. All claimants must be over 18 
years of age to claim any article of value.  

7.1 Employee Responsibilities 

A. Employees are to turn in found articles to either dispatch at 4305 E. 
21st Ave. or the representative at MTC at 1211 N. Marion St. the 
day the article is found.  Bicycles left in bike racks on buses may be 
turned into the MTC representative during the next inbound trip; if 
there is no representative at MTC to accept the bike and complete 
the lost and found process, the bike is to be brought back to 21st 
Avenue; the process is then to be completed at 21st Avenue 
between the operator and the on-duty dispatcher. 

B. Employees, supervisors or dispatchers turning in articles will 
fill out a lost and found form OP05-RV0608 indicating the date, 
time, name, route number, bus number if applicable, and a 
brief description of the article.  

C. Employees are not to drop off found articles at any location without 
face to face communication with a HART representative, 
dispatcher, or supervisor and are required to fill out their section of 
the Lost Article OP05-RV0608 Form. 

D. Streetcar - after notifying rail dispatch that an item has been found, 
items on the streetcars during the daytime hours are normally held 
onto by the motormen because many times patrons realize they left 
an item on the car and return to claim item within a short period of 
time or prior to the end of day. Motormen will also inform other 
motormen, for example “I found a camera if anyone comes looking 
for it I’m on streetcar # 4___.”. By doing this they do not disclose 
the brand name so the person attempting to claim the item will have 
to identify it.  Items not returned to customers that same day will be 
transported to MTC the next day by the Assistant Manager of 
Streetcar Operations. 

7.2 Dispatch/Transit Supervisor Responsibilities 

A. Dispatch will fill out the applicable part of the form with his/her 
name, date and time that the article was turned in. 

B. Bicycles and other large articles will be sent to the 21st Ave. facility 
and retained in the northeast fenced storage area.

process, including discovery, transport, inventory, claim and 
disposal. 

B. All found articles of value such as drivers license, wallets, bank or 
credit cards, cameras, lap top computers, keys, jewelry, 
eyeglasses, etc. and items of estimated value greater than $50.00 
or more will require a OPO5-RV0608 form.  

C. The gold copy of the form is kept by dispatch when the article is 
turned into dispatch by the employee/finder; the gold copy of the 
form is kept by customer service when the article is turned into 
customer service by the employee/person/finder. 

D. Before separating the gold copy of the form when the item is turned 
into dispatch, the name of the employee who found the article, the 
name of the dispatcher who takes in the item, and the name of the

1.0 SCOPE 

The purpose of this SOP is to develop guidelines for the design and placement of 
transit amenities. These guidelines serve to provide comfortable and convenient 
high quality amenities at bus stop locations, while considering the operational 
needs of the Transit Authority, the requirements of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA), other federal and state accessibility mandates, and public 
safety. 
 
This is recommended criteria and general guidance for the placement and safe 
design of transit amenities. These guidelines must be used in conjunction with 
sound evaluation of the facts and engineering. Each particular site must be 
thoroughly examined and each particular project must be evaluated from the 
aspect of safety, operational requirements, and cost-effectiveness. Design 
solutions may need to be adjusted to satisfy site specific constraints and 
applicable local ordinances. These guidelines are to be used for actions on new 
or revised stop locations, and for improvements to existing stop locations. 

 
1.1 Goals 

A. The goals of the guidelines are to: 

1. Promote consistency in bus stop placement and design 
throughout HART’s service area  

2. Encourage the members of the community to use public 
transit through the provision of safe, comfortable, and 
convenient transit amenities

4.0 BUS STOP STANDARDS 
 

Note: 
Any requested changes to the guidelines assigned to this SOP shall be 

thoroughly researched by the Manager of Passenger Amenities and Facilities and 
approved by the Chief of Maintenance and Engineering. 

 
A. Each bus stop location shall take into consideration a number of factors 

including: 

1. Spacing along the route. 
2. Location of the expected passenger traffic generator, either based 

on population density or specific use (i.e. major employment 
centers, regional shopping centers, hospitals, etc.). 

3. Traffic safety. 
4. Pedestrian safety and access to a stop. 

a. Pathways leading to and from bus stop areas shall be level, 
have a firm surface, and be free of obstacles 

5. Availability of adequate right-of-way to ensure that the bus stop 
meets the ADA accessibility standards. 

6. Curb clearance – adequate space for buses to stop, and return to 
the traffic flow. 

7. Operational effectiveness issues (including relation to the nearest 
intersection, bus turning requirements, and re-entering the travel 
lane). 

 
B. Because of the number of factors involved, each new or relocated stop 

must be examined on a case-by-case basis. General guidelines for stop 
spacing and placement follow. 

 
4.1 Bus Stop Spacing 

 
A. Local bus stops shall be placed no less than 750 and no greater 

than 1,250 feet apart. 
 
B. Express bus stops shall be placed not to exceed 12 bus stops in 

any one direction of the route not including the Marion Transit 
Parkway and Marion Transit Center. 

 
C. Any exception to this guideline requires approval from HART’s 

Chief Executive Officer. 
 
D. It is important to consider the unique circumstances at each 

intersection when selecting bus stop locations, including:

                                                                                                                                                                   5 

1. Proximity to major trip generators. 
2. Presence of sidewalks and curb ramps leading to trip 

generators and nearby pedestrian circulation system. 
3. Width, placement and condition of sidewalks. 
4. Protected crossings at signalized or stop-controlled 

intersections, or at crosswalks. 
5. Convenient passenger transfers to other routes. 
6. Effect on adjacent property owners. 
7. Conflict between buses, other traffic, and pedestrians. 
8. Pedestrian activity through intersections. 
9. Open and visible spaces for personal security and 

passenger visibility. 
10. Street illumination. 
11. Adequate curb space for the number of buses expected at 

the stop at any one time. 
12. Volume and turning movements of other traffic, including 

bicycles. 
13. Proximity and traffic volumes of nearby driveways. 
14. Street and sidewalk grade. 
15. Ease for bus re-entering traffic stream. 
16. Bus route turns. 
17. Unusual intersection angles or predominant turning 

movements. 
18. Proximity to rail crossings or emergency driveways. 
19. Sight distance at adjacent intersections and driveways. 

 
E. Bus stops are generally located at intersections where they may be 

placed on the near side or far side of an intersection. This 
maximizes pedestrian accessibility from both sides of the street and 
provides connection to intersecting bus routes. Under certain 
situations, bus stops may also be placed at a mid-block location. 

 
F. General considerations for the placement of bus stops at major 

intersections  include: 

1. When the route alignment requires a left turn, the preferred 
location for the bus stop is on the far side of the intersection 
approximately 75 feet after the left turn is completed.

                                                                                                                                                                   6 

2. When the route alignment requires a left turn and it is 
unfeasible or undesirable to locate a bus stop on the far side 
of the intersection after the left turn, a mid-block location is 
preferred. A mid-block bus stop shall be located at least 250 
feet from the intersection so a bus can maneuver into the 
proper lane to turn left. 

3. If there is a high volume of right turns at an intersection, the 
preferred location for a stop is on the far side of the 
intersection after the turn. 

4. If the transit route turns right at an intersection, the preferred 
location for a stop is after the bus has turned. 

5. In circumstances where the accumulation of buses at a far 
side stop would spill over into the intersection and additional 
length is not available, the stop shall be placed on the near 
side of the intersection.  

6. At complex intersections with multi-phase signals or dual 
right or left turn lanes, far side stops are preferred because 
they remove the buses from the area of complicated traffic 
movements at that intersection. 

7. When transfer activity between two lines exhibits a strong 
direction pairing (i.e. heavy volumes from westbound to 
northbound) placing one stop near side and one far side can 
minimize pedestrian activity within the intersection. 

 
4.2  Abutting Property Owners / Tenants 

 
A. To promote good public relations, it is desirable that bus stops be 

placed at locations where they will minimize the annoyance to the 
adjacent residents or business owners.  

B. Some commercial establishments are interested in having a bus 
stop placed in front of their establishment, while residents may 
object to the presence of a bus stop in front of their home, 
especially if the stop is used for layovers.  

C. All efforts shall be taken to minimize the impact to each property 
owner, but vehicle and pedestrian safety shall be the over-riding 
factor in determining the final bus stop location. 

 
4.3  Bus Stops and Driveways 

 
A. Whenever possible, bus stops shall not be placed near a driveway.  

However, if placement near a driveway is unavoidable:

                                                                                                                                                                   7 

1. Attempt to keep at least one exit and entrance open to 
vehicles accessing the property while a bus is loading or 
unloading passengers.  

2. When there are two driveways to a parcel on the same 
street, the upstream driveway shall be blocked forcing 
vehicles to turn behind the bus to access the driveway. 

3. It is preferable to fully rather than partially block a driveway 
to prevent vehicles from attempting to squeeze by the bus in 
a situation with reduced sight distance. 

4. Locate bus stops to allow good visibility for vehicles leaving 
the property and to minimize vehicle/bus conflicts. This is 
best accomplished by placing bus stops where driveways 
are behind the stopped bus. 

5. Ensure that passengers have a safe area to wait when 
loading must occur in or adjacent to a driveway. 

  
4.4 Additional Factors in Selecting a Bus Stop Location 

 
4.4.1 Sidewalk Conditions  

 
A. Stops shall be located and constructed to make use of 

existing sidewalk facilities, or new sidewalk facilities shall 
be constructed by an outside contractor to provide 
pedestrian access to the bus stop.   

B. At stops with heavy ridership, additional passenger 
waiting/standing areas shall be constructed off of the main 
sidewalk so that waiting passengers do not block passage 
of other pedestrians. 

 
4.4.2 Crosswalks  

 
A. Bus stops shall be located close to existing crosswalks to 

encourage safe pedestrian crossings, but also located so 
that a stopped bus will neither block a crosswalk nor 
obstruct pedestrian visibility of oncoming traffic and vice-
versa. In general, it is safer to locate the bus stop on the 
far side of a crosswalk, so that passengers will cross 
behind, rather than in front of, the bus. 

 
4.4.3 Landscaping Issues  

 
A. The presence of trees and bushes at a bus stop may 

necessitate periodic trimming at the stop as noted in 
Section 6.8.B.7 of this document to prevent buses from

hitting tree branches and bushes from encroaching on 
sidewalks. 

B. Tall bushes are also a potential security problem, and 
additional lighting shall be considered at stops with this 
issue. 

 
4.4.4 Lighting 

 
A. Adequate lighting is important for passenger comfort and 

security as well as for visibility of waiting passengers to the 
bus and other oncoming traffic.  

B. Bus stops which are served after dark shall be located 
where they will be illuminated at night, preferably from an 
overhead street light. If this is not possible, lighting shall be 
installed at the stop.  

1. If at a shelter, solar light kits will be installed by 
route maintenance or the shelter contractor.   

2. I-stop light poles will be installed at locations without 
shelters. 

 
4.4.5 Limited Visibility Over Hills and Around Curves  

 
A. Bus stops shall not be located over the crest of a hill, 

immediately after a road curve to the right, or at other 
locations that limit the visibility of the stopped bus to 
oncoming traffic.  

 
4.4.6 On-Street Parking  

 
A. Locating a bus stop in an area with existing curbside 

parking requires removal of enough parking area to permit 
the bus to pull off, service the stop, and re-enter the travel 
lane. 

 
4.4.7 Proximity to Major Trip Generators  

 
A. When feasible, a bus stop shall be located to minimize 

walking distances to the activity center that is expected to 
generate the most ridership.

4.4.8 Right-of-Way Considerations  
 

A. If a bus stop may be a future candidate for transit shelter or 
bench installation, a site shall be selected that includes 
adequate right-of-way for constructing improvements. 

 
4.4.9 Transfer Locations  

 
A. Bus stops where transfer activity between routes is heavy 

shall be located such as to minimize street crossings of 
passengers transferring to other routes. 

 
4.4.10 Compatibility with Adjacent Properties  

 
A. Care shall be taken to avoid locating a bus stop 

immediately adjacent to land uses which are highly 
sensitive to the effects of bus fumes and noise. 

4.4.11 Drainage  
 

A. Areas which tend to accumulate standing water shall be 
avoided or improved. Bus stops shall not be located so that 
passengers are required to step over catch basins when 
descending from the bus, as this creates a potential 
tripping hazard. 

 
4.4.12 Bicycle Facilities 

 
A. Bus stops shall be located so they do not block bicycle 

travel lanes.  

B. Bus stops shall be located so that bicycle racks do not 
block pedestrian access to entering and exiting the bus. 

 
4.5 Requests for Changes in Bus Stops 

 
A. The Manager of Passenger Amenities and Facilities or his/her 

designated route maintenance staff will review requests and 
determine if the change will comply with guidelines set forth in 
Section 4.1.A and/or Section 4.1.B of this document. 

 
5.0 MINIMUM BUS STOP ELEMENTS 
 

5.1 Landing Area 
 

Bus stop sites shall be chosen such that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, lifts or ramps can be deployed on a firm, stable surface as to 



SOP 
NUMBER REV PAGE 

SUBJECT: BUS STOP STANDARDS 

GSOP-0010  10 of 16
 

                                                                                                                                                                   10 

permit a wheelchair or mobility aid user to maneuver safely onto or off the 
bus and bus stop. 

 
A. Dimensions 

1. The minimum landing area requirement for a bus stop (the 
area from which passengers board the bus and onto which 
passengers exit the bus) is a continuous, unobstructed solid 
area contiguous to the curb that measures at least 5 feet 
parallel to the street and at least 8 feet perpendicular to the 
street at the front door. These are the minimum dimensions 
needed to deploy a lift or ramp and allow a customer in a 
wheelchair to board or exit the vehicle (28 CFR Part 36 
10.2.1).  

B. Slope  
 

1. The slope of the landing area must be parallel to the slope of 
the roadway in order for the bus wheelchair lift or ramp to be 
effectively deployed.   

2. The slope shall not exceed 1 foot vertical over 20 feet 
horizontal (5%), and the cross slope shall not exceed 1 foot 
vertical over 50 feet horizontal (2%) (28 CFR Part 36 4.3.7).  

 
C. Surface Material 

 
1. The landing area must be firm, stable, and slip-resistant. 

Concrete is the preferred surface for the landing area. It is 
possible for the lift or ramp to span an area of another 
material, such as grass or soil in a planter strip between the 
curb and the sidewalk. However, for the safety of ambulatory 
customers who may stumble on an uneven surface, it is 
strongly recommended to construct a continuous concrete 
pad.   

2. In newer developments where a new bus stop will be placed, 
a continuous surface from the curb and the sidewalk shall be 
provided for the purposes of deploying a bus ramp or lift for 
wheelchairs or other mobility devices.   

 
D. Height Relative to the Street  

 
1. It is preferable that the landing area be elevated above street 

level for pedestrian safety.  

2. For stops served by low-floor, ramp equipped buses a 
standard curb provides an acceptable ramp slope.

E. Clearances  
 

A minimum clearance of 36 inches shall be maintained between 
obstructions in boarding areas (28 CFR Part 36 4.3.3). 

5.2 Pedestrian Connections 
 

A. To be fully useable, a landing area of 5 feet wide and 8 feet in 
length (ADAAG, 10.2.1) must be connected to a sidewalk of 
sufficient width and condition for a person in a wheelchair to use 
(ADAAG 4.3, 4.5) - the narrowest useable width is 4 feet.   

 
B. If items such as newspaper boxes, utility poles, trash cans, and 

encroaching grass or bushes constrict a portion of the sidewalk to 
less than 4 feet, the sidewalk is not accessible to wheelchair users. 
If necessary, the existing sidewalk shall be widened or new 
sidewalk constructed by an outside contractor to ensure that 
customers are able to get to and from the bus stop. To the extent 
feasible, sidewalk connections around bus stops shall provide safe 
pedestrian access to the passenger trip generators near the bus 
stop. Land uses shall be designed to facilitate the movement, and 
minimize the distances between the development and the transit 
services. Good pedestrian access can be achieved by considering 
the following guiding principles: 

 
1. Pedestrian routes to bus stops shall be designed to meet the 

needs of all users (including disabled, elderly, and children). 
2. The pedestrian system shall provide convenient connections 

between destinations including residential areas, schools, 
shopping centers, public services and institutions, recreation, 
and transit. 

3. A dedicated sidewalk and/or bike paths shall be provided 
through new developments that are safe and direct to the 
nearest bus stop or transit center. 

4. Minimize the distance between buildings and the bus stop 
through proximity and orientation. This can be encouraged 
by including transit accessibility concerns in zoning policies, 
setback guidelines, building orientation guidelines, and 
parking requirements to encourage transit oriented 
development. 

5. Minimize the use of elements that restrict pedestrian 
movement such as meandering sidewalks, walled 
communities, and expansive parking lots.  

6. Pathways shall be designed so pedestrians traverse as 
straight a path as possible.

6.5 Route and Corridor Selections 
  

A. Routes and corridors that meet the following criteria will be first 
candidates for programmed ADA improvements: 

1. Routes that are under consideration for route realignment by 
the planning department 

2. Routes and corridors whose rights of way are controlled by a 
single entity 

3. Routes and corridors that do not have any scheduled road 
improvement projects within the next 5 years 

4. Routes and corridors that have a greater number of stops 
considered to be made more easily accessible than other 
routes and corridors 

B. HART will use datasets of existing conditions such as stop and 
route ridership and the study to build a geo-database in GIS that 
will be the source of information for analytical decision making. 

 
C. Drivers, maintenance personnel, and other HART personnel will 

provide continuous input to the Construction Services Project 
Manager I for updates for the datasets.  

  
6.6 Route and Corridor Based Bus Stop Evaluations 

 
A. Once a route or corridor has been selected, engineering and 

planning will review current locations to recommend stops for 
elimination, consolidation, relocation or potential routing 
realignment. 

 
B. The intent is to create ‘permanent’ stop locations that meet the 

needs of the riders, are safe, secure and accessible to the 
maximum extent practicable. Those recommendations will be 
forwarded to the Manager of Passenger Amenities and Facilities 
for investigation and concurrence. 

 
C. The engineering GIS geo-database will be the screening tool 

used to evaluate stops. Within it, data from the study describing 
existing conditions combined with current APC ridership data will 
be the primary screening criteria. Candidate stops for relocation & 
improvements will be identified based on: 

1. screening criteria 
2. available budget  
3. targeted number of stops for improvement

D. Permanent stop locations will be developed based on multiple 
considerations, including but not limited to: 

1. ridership 
2. proximity to trip generators  
3. transferring routes 
4. ability to improve accessibility 
5. other adjoining bus stop locations   
 

E. For a full range of considerations refer to GSOP-0010 - Bus Stop 
Standards and the Bus Stop & Facilities Technical Design 
Standards Manual included in the study. If the two documents 
conflict, GSOP-0010 shall take precedence. 

 
F. Each corridor of stops to be relocated, eliminated or improved will 

warrant a field visit by the Construction Services Project Manager 
I to confirm viability during which all needed data will be collected 
for design, permitting and construction, where needed. The geo-
database will be updated as required. 

 
G. After completing the Route bus stop evaluation, Engineering will 

distribute recommendations for stop consolidations, construction 
and minor items that require prompt attention to Operations, 
Planning and Maintenance for review, with the opportunity to 
provide feedback. 

 
H. Route Maintenance will apply all corridor stop fixes that do not 

require construction. 
 

6.7 Construction of ADA Bus Stop Improvements 
 

A. Design for construction of ADA Improvements at stops will be 
initiated by the EPM.   

 
B. Those stops which can be improved without impacts to drainage 

or other infrastructure, or needing more information on the right-
of-way will have single page drawings drafted by HART GIS staff. 

 
C. Generally, HART will not target stops for improvement where 

bridges or handrails would be required to be installed, unless that 
stop is actively being used by an individual that requires that 
improvement to use the stop and cannot reasonably access 
another compliant stop. If such stop can be brought into 
compliance by relocation this will be a preferred option.

D. If a stop requires additional engineering for improvements, either 
a task order shall be issued through HART’s General Engineering 
Consultant contract or follow other procurement protocol as 
deemed appropriate. Full site surveys will be undertaken where 
necessary. 

 
E. All permitting will be handled by the EPM. A single permit will be 

sought for each corridor. The requirements for the singular permit 
to cover all stop improvements are one roadway with one right-of-
way jurisdiction. 

 
F. Once the permit has been issued, the EPM will issue a task order 

for construction through the General Construction Services 
contract. It is anticipated that task orders for construction will be 
on a per route basis with details of the scope and schedule. 

 
G. The construction process will be dictated by GSOP-0010 – Bus 

Stop Standards and as called for in the procurement scope or 
contract.   

 
H. Once construction is complete, the EPM will inspect each 

improved site for adherence to plans and confirm accessibility 
improvements. Pictures will be taken and the geo-database will 
be updated.   

 
I. The contractor will call in for final permit inspections after approval 

from the EPM. 

J. After improvements are completed through this process, 
passenger amenities employees shall maintain the bus stops.

1.0 PURPOSE 

The mission of the Maintenance Department is to provide safe, clean, and 
reliable vehicles to our customers. As such, the department provides a product 
and service that primarily supports the Operations Department. Due to the need 
for many support functions within this industry, other services are provided 
throughout the agency. This mission is accomplished through the implementation 
of our Fleet Maintenance Plan. 

2.0 OVERVIEW 

The development of the Fleet Maintenance Plan sets the stage for how crucial 
elements of our mission are implemented and processed. This section marks the 
needed accomplishments to perform the most important actions within our 
business. The Fleet Maintenance Plan is a systematic way to manage change 
while improving service and performance. This is a continuous process of 
interaction between management and labor so that a clear identification of 
mission is apparent. The Plan focuses on four established work-types, and 
provides vision on how to function under each. These work-types are as follows: 

A. Condition-Based 

Maintenance performed on the vehicle’s exterior, interior, and/or 
mechanical condition. 

B. Corrective 

The corrective repair of vehicles due to accidents, unscheduled 
mechanical failures, etc. 

C. Fixed Scheduled 

Maintenance scheduled and based upon the life-cycle of the vehicle’s 
components. 

D. Campaigns 

Fleet configuration modifications driven by OEM requirements and/or 
efficiencies. 

3.0 GOALS 

 Manage mean distance between service calls 

1. Increase emphasis on Preventative Maintenance Inspections 

2. Decrease Service Call labor hours by 5% 

3. Reallocate labor from Corrective to Condition-based by 10%

Five of the divisions are covered under this Vehicle Maintenance Plan while the 
other two will be addressed in the Facility Maintenance and Passenger Amenities 
Plan. 
 
Fleet Maintenance includes all Condition-based Maintenance, Corrective and 
Fixed Scheduled Maintenance. Condition-based Maintenance is synonymous 
with preventive maintenance. The preventive maintenance program ensures that 
vehicle systems are routinely inspected and repaired to minimize premature 
failure. These systems include air conditioning, wheelchair equipment, electrical 
components, safety systems, and similar sub-groups. An aggressive vehicle-
cleaning program continues to enhance our image with the riding public. The 
focus is on the overall appearance of the vehicles, both interior and exterior. 
Other responsibilities include warranty processing management and quality 
assurance/quality control program administration. 
 
Technical Services responsibilities include warranty recovery, vehicle 
specification development, fleet maintenance program management, quality 
assurance/quality control program administration, capital project management, 
fleet planning, and fixed scheduled work program management. Additional 
responsibilities include new hire training, technical training, safety training, 
compliance training and equipment training for all maintenance staff.  The 
emphasis is on mechanic training although the training section also provides 
paint and body, facilities and route maintenance, and communication/electronic 
classes. There is labor cost associated with the time needed for employees to be 
in training classes. The result, however, is a more efficient and effective 
workforce.  
 
Communications and Electronics is responsible for maintaining HART’s 
communications and electronic equipment. Communication equipment consists 
of all radio equipment including the dispatch radio equipment, vehicle radios, 
radio shelter equipment and tower, automated passenger counters, automatic 
vehicle location system, and the video/audio systems. The Communications and 
Electronics staff also maintains destination signs, fare collection systems and 
computer electronics for the fleet.   
 
Streetcar Maintenance is responsible for the maintenance of ten streetcars, 
system right-of-way, rail stations, and the Ybor City maintenance and operating 
facility. This includes all Condition-based Maintenance, Corrective and Fixed 
Scheduled Maintenance. Condition-based Maintenance is synonymous with 
preventive maintenance. The preventive maintenance program ensures that 
vehicle systems are routinely inspected and repaired to minimize premature 
failure. These systems include air conditioning, electrical components, safety 
systems, and similar sub-groups. An aggressive vehicle-cleaning program 
continues to enhance our image with the riding public. The focus is on the overall 
appearance of the vehicles, both interior and exterior. Other responsibilities 
include warranty processing management and quality assurance/quality control 
program administration. There are no plans for purchase of additional streetcars

or expansion of the streetcar system at this time. Ten (10) streetcars were 
purchased to begin service in the Ybor and Channelside district. Due to funds 
constraints the street car system operates at a peak of three cars during the 
week. There is an annual event put on by the City of Tampa called Gasparilla 
which requires a peak of between 6-8 cars depending on attendance. This 
justifies the number of cars for spare ratio.  
 
The streetcar system operates; 
 
12PM to 10PM Mon-Thurs 
11AM to   2AM Fri-Sat 
12Pm to  8PM Sun    
 
The rail fleet management plan is structured to support the tri-party Operators 
Agreement for the TecoLine streetcar system with Tampa Historic Streetcar Inc. 
and the City of Tampa.  
 
 
The division consists of 140 positions in FY 2014, and projections for FY 2015 
are shown on the following tables.

6.0 SCHEDULED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM 
 

The HART Preventive Maintenance Program is based on a progressive 6,000-
mile inspection for fixed route vehicles, 4,000-mile inspection for vans and a 
progressive 3,000-mile inspection for all other service, supervisory and support 
vehicles. This is supplemented by daily driver pre-trip inspections for all revenue 
vehicles. 

 
6.1  

 
 Prior to the operation of a coach or support van, each operator 

will check the vehicle for the following: 
 

1. Operation of all lights 

2. Operation of wheelchair lift 

3. Farebox proper operation 

4. Condition of all tires and lug nuts 

5. Body damage (interior and exterior) 

6. All operation controls (doors, etc.) 

7. Fluid leaks 

8. Vehicle cleanliness (interior and exterior) 
 

 At the completion of their run, operators will note any vehicle 
deficiencies on the defect card located in the vehicle. The defect 
card is collected by maintenance nightly. If during the operation of 
a vehicle, a defect occurs that requires immediate attention, the 
operator will call the dispatch office by radio, the shop supervisor 
will then be notified, and a replacement vehicle will be dispatched 
or mechanic will repair the vehicle en route. 

 
6.2 FLEET SERVICE PERSONNEL 

 
 This work is performed from the hours of 7:00 p.m. through 3:30 

a.m. nightly. The following tasks are completed: 

1.  Fueling 

2. Check engine coolant 

3. Check engine oil 

4. Check power steering fluid 

5. Clean coach interior 

6. Wash coach exterior

1.0      PURPOSE 

The mission of the Maintenance Department is to provide safe, clean, and 
reliable vehicles to our customers. As such, the department provides a product 
and service that primarily supports the Operations Department. Due to the need 
for many support functions within this industry, other services are provided 
throughout the agency. This mission is accomplished through the implementation 
of our Fleet Maintenance Plan. 

2.0 OVERVIEW 

The development of the Fleet Maintenance Plan sets the stage for how crucial 
elements of our mission are implemented and processed. This section marks the 
needed accomplishments to perform the most important actions within our 
business. The Fleet Maintenance Plan is a systematic way to manage change 
while improving service and performance. This is a continuous process of 
interaction between management and labor so that a clear identification of 
mission is apparent. The Plan focuses on four established work-types, and 
provides vision on how to function under each. These work-types are as follows: 

A. Condition-Based 

Maintenance performed on the vehicle’s exterior, interior, and/or 
mechanical condition. 

B. Corrective 

The corrective repair of vehicles due to accidents, unscheduled 
mechanical failures, etc. 

C. Fixed Scheduled 

Maintenance scheduled and based upon the life-cycle of the vehicle’s 
components. 

D. Campaigns 

Fleet configuration modifications driven by OEM requirements and/or 
efficiencies. 

3.0 GOALS 

 Manage mean distance between service calls 

1. Increase emphasis on Preventative Maintenance Inspections 

2. Decrease Service Call labor hours by 5% 

3. Reallocate labor from Corrective to Condition-based by 10%

Five of the divisions are covered under this Vehicle Maintenance Plan while the 
other two will be addressed in the Facility Maintenance and Passenger Amenities 
Plan. 
 
Fleet Maintenance includes all Condition-based Maintenance, Corrective and 
Fixed Scheduled Maintenance. Condition-based Maintenance is synonymous 
with preventive maintenance. The preventive maintenance program ensures that 
vehicle systems are routinely inspected and repaired to minimize premature 
failure. These systems include air conditioning, wheelchair equipment, electrical 
components, safety systems, and similar sub-groups. An aggressive vehicle-
cleaning program continues to enhance our image with the riding public. The 
focus is on the overall appearance of the vehicles, both interior and exterior. 
Other responsibilities include warranty processing management and quality 
assurance/quality control program administration. 
 
Technical Services responsibilities include warranty recovery, vehicle 
specification development, fleet maintenance program management, quality 
assurance/quality control program administration, capital project management, 
fleet planning, and fixed scheduled work program management. Additional 
responsibilities include new hire training, technical training, safety training, 
compliance training and equipment training for all maintenance staff.  The 
emphasis is on mechanic training although the training section also provides 
paint and body, facilities and route maintenance, and communication/electronic 
classes. There is labor cost associated with the time needed for employees to be 
in training classes. The result, however, is a more efficient and effective 
workforce.  
 
Communications and Electronics is responsible for maintaining HART’s 
communications and electronic equipment. Communication equipment consists 
of all radio equipment including the dispatch radio equipment, vehicle radios, 
radio shelter equipment and tower, automated passenger counters, automatic 
vehicle location system, and the video/audio systems. The Communications and 
Electronics staff also maintains destination signs, fare collection systems and 
computer electronics for the fleet.   
 
Streetcar Maintenance is responsible for the maintenance of ten streetcars, 
system right-of-way, rail stations, and the Ybor City maintenance and operating 
facility. This includes all Condition-based Maintenance, Corrective and Fixed 
Scheduled Maintenance. Condition-based Maintenance is synonymous with 
preventive maintenance. The preventive maintenance program ensures that 
vehicle systems are routinely inspected and repaired to minimize premature 
failure. These systems include air conditioning, electrical components, safety 
systems, and similar sub-groups. An aggressive vehicle-cleaning program 
continues to enhance our image with the riding public. The focus is on the overall

appearance of the vehicles, both interior and exterior. Other responsibilities 
include warranty processing management and quality assurance/quality control 
program administration. There are no plans for purchase of additional streetcars 
or expansion of the streetcar system at this time. Ten (10) streetcars were 
purchased to begin service in the Ybor and Channelside district. Due to funds 
constraints the street car system operates at a peak of three cars during the 
week. There is an annual event put on by the City of Tampa called Gasparilla 
which requires a peak of between 6-8 cars depending on attendance. This 
justifies the number of cars for spare ratio.  
 
The streetcar system operates; 
 
12PM to 10PM Mon-Thurs 
11AM to   2AM Fri-Sat 
12Pm to   8PM Sun    
 
The rail fleet management plan is structured to support the tri-party Operators 
Agreement for the TecoLine streetcar system with Tampa Historic Streetcar Inc. 
and the City of Tampa.  
 
 
The division consists of 145 positions in FY 2015 as shown in the following 
tables.

service.”  When failures occur, they are radioed in by the driver 
to dispatch. 

 
2. Dispatch then sends an email to the Maintenance Shop to notify 

all supervisors and managers that a driver is taking a spare 
vehicle to the disabled bus. 

 
3. If dispatch needs maintenance assistance prior to the change-

out they also call the Maintenance Shop.

6.0 SCHEDULED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM 
 
The HART Preventive Maintenance Program is based on a progressive 6,000-mile 
inspection for fixed route vehicles, 6,000-mile inspection for vans, 4,000-mile inspection 
for sedan style and a progressive 3,000-mile inspection for all other service, supervisory 
and support vehicles. Annual Inspection schedule requires 36,000 mile progressive 
level preventative maintenance inspections serve as HART’s annual safety inspection.  
If a vehicle does not make the 36,000 mileage for the annual inspection it is scheduled 
for the 36,000 mile annual inspection within twelve (12) months of the last annual 
inspection.  HART completes CNG tank and system Inspections on all vehicles 
equipped with Compressed Natural Gas. Inspections are required on the tanks and 
system every three years or 36, 000 miles or any time the vehicle is involved in a crash 
5 mph or above.  All repair work is completed before the vehicle is scheduled back into 
service so the repair date for any corrective action is the same as the date of the annual

1. PURPOSE 

The mission of the Passenger Amenities and Facility Maintenance Department is 
to provide safe, clean, and reliable facilities and equipment to our patrons and 
employees. The department provides a product and service that primarily 
supports the Maintenance Department. Due to the need for many support 
functions within this industry, other services are provided throughout the agency.  

2. OVERVIEW 

The Passenger Amenities and Facilities Maintenance Department has the 
responsibility of maintaining all equipment and facilities used to continue transit 
service. A large portion of the equipment is used for the repair of transit vehicles, 
such as the bus lifts, fueling and fluid systems, and air compressors are serviced 
by Facility Maintenance personnel. 

In order to meet our goal of providing a high standard of service as efficiently as 
possible this plan has been developed.

maintenance facilities, and several transit centers.  
 

 In addition to the equipment manufacturer’s requirements, facility 
maintenance personnel perform daily visual inspections of safety items.    

 
 Facilities are evaluated to ensure safe and clean environments for patrons 

and employees. Maintenance employees undergo training to update their 
skills to ensure equipment is properly maintained and operational.    

 
 The Department uses performance standards to judge its efficiency and 

effectiveness. The goals are as follows: 
 

1. No equipment damage due to improperly maintained facilities. 

2. No bodily injury to patrons or employees due to a facility defect. 

3. No environmental impacts due to improperly maintained facility   
equipment. 

 
It is our expectation, confirmed by experience that through this maintenance plan 
the Hillsborough Transit Authority will easily meet its performance standards. 
 

4. FACILITY PROFILE 

Facility Maintenance is a branch of the Maintenance Department and consists of 
two separate sections which are responsible for the maintenance of 5 transit 
centers, 1 transfer station, 2 operations facilities, and support systems utilized to 
provide service to our customers.       

 

Facility Maintenance is responsible for maintaining the buildings and grounds of 
HART’s Facility at 21st Avenue, Ybor Administrative and Streetcar Facility, 
Marion Transit Center, Netp@rk Transit Center, University Area Transit Center, 
West Tampa Transit Center, North West Transit Center, Yukon Transfer Center, 
and Marion Street Transitway. Other responsibilities include the monitoring of all 
capital improvement projects and assisting in the creation of project 
specifications.  Maintenance of the facilities, landscaping, lawn service, and 
certain facility upgrades are all cost drivers.   
 
Passenger Amenities Maintenance is responsible for the maintenance of over 
3,212 bus stops, 711 shelters, 1022 benches, 795 trash receptacles and 21 park-
and-ride lots. The bus stops must be cleaned and maintained on a scheduled 
basis. A bus stop sign identification and tracking program has been completed to 
identify location of needed repair.  A large number of new shelters with 
passenger amenities such as benches, trash receptacles and bicycle racks at 
bus stops are being added to the existing inventory, which is resulting in

scheduled for completion in FY2016. 

 
 Facilities Assessment 

1. This project will assist HART with the development of a 5 year 
strategic plan for capital project improvements. A design team of 
engineers will assess all facilities to complete a report of the 
current conditions. The review will include: 

i. Two Administration Buildings - 7th Avenue (17,800sf) 
and 21st Avenue (17,200sf). 

ii. Heavy/Preventive Maintenance Buildings 
(55,00sf/15,600sf) 

iii. University Area Transit Center (900sf) 
iv. Marion Transit Centers (9,800sf) 
v. Four Transfer Centers (avg 1,120sf) 

 21st Avenue Storm Water Project 

1. This project involves the evaluation and possible replacement of 
the stormwater drainage system for the 21st Avenue bus parking 
lot. The existing drainage system is old and has endured 
significant wear and tear. This has led to failures in the inlets, 
joints and the pipes which results in the erosion of the 
surrounding parking lot subgrade and the deterioration of the 
paved parking lot surface. During periods of heavy rainfall, there 
is significant flooding or pooling of water which causes buses to 
be submerged in water to a depth of 18” that damages plywood 
flooring of buses and disrupts the operations at the facility. 

 Heavy Maintenance/Preventive Maintenance Roof Design 

1. The roof project includes investigation of the existing roof framing 
condition for both the Heavy Maintenance and Preventive 
maintenance Buildings by a licensed structural engineer. A final 
report listing deficiencies and recommendations will be provided 
to HART for both buildings. We will then proceed into design that 
will include either repair or replacement of the current roof 
system, including gutters, lightning protection, access ladders and 
designated locations to tie off safely for workers who require roof 
access. 

 Equipment Replacement 

1. Several renovations to be completed this fiscal year will include 
the renovation of the restrooms at the Marion Transit Center, 
Replacement of the steam bay lift in the Preventive Maintenance 
buildings, Four sets of portable bus lifts, two air compressors for

1. PURPOSE 

The mission of the Passenger Amenities and Facility Maintenance Department is 
to provide safe, clean, and reliable facilities and equipment to our patrons and 
employees. The department provides a product and service that primarily 
supports the Maintenance Department. Due to the need for many support 
functions within this industry, other services are provided throughout the agency.  

2. OVERVIEW 

The Passenger Amenities and Facilities Maintenance Department has the 
responsibility of maintaining all equipment and facilities used to continue transit 
service. A large portion of the equipment is used for the repair of transit vehicles, 
such as the bus lifts, fueling and fluid systems, and air compressors are serviced 
by Facility Maintenance personnel. 

In order to meet our goal of providing a high standard of service as efficiently as 
possible this plan has been developed.  

A. Condition-Based 

Preventive Maintenance Inspections 
Repairs or maintenance performed on equipment in accordance with 
manufacturer’s recommendations and/or mechanical condition. 

Strategy 

 Performed by Skilled Labor 

 Inspection performed in accordance with manufacturer 
recommendations 

 Inspection types are scheduled and condition-based 
 

B. Corrective-Based 

Corrective repair performed on equipment due to unscheduled mechanical 
failures. 

Strategy 

 Performed by Skilled Labor 

 Performed as a result of reported failure 

3. GOALS  

Goals for maintaining the facilities are based upon the organizational needs and 
service requirements. 

 
 Equipment is maintained at the administration, streetcar, operations and

maintenance facilities, and several transit centers.  
 

 In addition to the equipment manufacturer’s requirements, facility 
maintenance personnel perform daily visual inspections of safety items.    

 
 Facilities are evaluated to ensure safe and clean environments for patrons 

and employees. Maintenance employees undergo training to update their 
skills to ensure equipment is properly maintained and operational.    

 
 The Department uses performance standards to judge its efficiency and 

effectiveness. The goals are as follows: 
 

1. No equipment damage due to improperly maintained facilities. 

2. No bodily injury to patrons or employees due to a facility defect. 

3. No environmental impacts due to improperly maintained facility   
equipment. 

 
It is our expectation, confirmed by experience that through this maintenance plan 
the Hillsborough Transit Authority will easily meet its performance standards. 
 

4. FACILITY PROFILE 

Facility Maintenance is a branch of the Maintenance Department and consists of 
two separate sections which are responsible for the maintenance of 5 transit 
centers, 1 transfer station, 2 operations facilities, and support systems utilized to 
provide service to our customers.       

 

Facility Maintenance is responsible for maintaining the buildings and grounds of 
HART’s Facility at 21st Avenue, Ybor Administrative and Streetcar Facility, 
Marion Transit Center, Netp@rk Transit Center, University Area Transit Center,

and Marion Street Transitway. Other responsibilities include the monitoring of all 
capital improvement projects and assisting in the creation of project 
specifications.  Maintenance of the facilities, landscaping, lawn service, and 
certain facility upgrades are all cost drivers.  
 
The facilities equipment used in support of the public transit will be maintained at 
a minimum to the specifications of the Operation and Maintenance manual 
provided with the equipment. The Facility Manager will insure the following 
routine maintenance and care functions are provided by staff or an outside

 Most of the park and ride facilities have a combination of patron shelters, 
benches, kiosks, and trash containers. Park and ride facilities and 
amenities are maintained by passenger amenities and facilities 
maintenance personnel. Maintenance of the facilities is documented and 
maintained through work orders in electronic format.   

 
5. FACILITY PROJECTIONS 

At this time, there are several facility upgrades that are in the early stages of 
development. The projects include the renovation of the Heavy Maintenance 
Building, A Facility Assessment for all current facilities, an assessment of the 
storm water drainage system at the 21st Avenue facility and roof replacements for 
the Heavy Maintenance and Preventive Maintenance Buildings as detailed 
below.

 Heavy Maintenance Building Renovation Project 

1. The upgrade and renovation of the 55,500 sf facility will provide 
an efficient and safe work environment for maintenance staff as 
well as ensure the facility is in compliance with current code 
requirements and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The 
modifications will include, replacement of the HVAC system, the 
addition of an emergency back-up generator, electrical switchgear 
upgrades, replacement of bus paint-booth, fire alarm system, 
refurbishment/efficiency modifications on both floors and 
upgrades to the restrooms and break rooms. This project is 
scheduled for completion in FY2016. 

 
 Facilities Assessment 

1. This project will assist HART with the development of a 5 year 
strategic plan for capital project improvements. A design team of 
engineers will assess all facilities to complete a report of the 
current conditions. The review will include: 

i. Two Administration Buildings - 7th Avenue (17,800sf) 
and 21st Avenue (17,200sf). 

ii. Heavy/Preventive Maintenance Buildings 
(55,00sf/15,600sf) 

iii. University Area Transit Center (900sf) 
iv. Marion Transit Centers (9,800sf) 
v. Four Transfer Centers (avg 1,120sf) 

 21st Avenue Storm Water Project 

1. This project involves the evaluation and possible replacement of 
the stormwater drainage system for the 21st Avenue bus parking 
lot. The existing drainage system is old and has endured 
significant wear and tear. This has led to failures in the inlets, 
joints and the pipes which results in the erosion of the 
surrounding parking lot subgrade and the deterioration of the 
paved parking lot surface. During periods of heavy rainfall, there 
is significant flooding or pooling of water which causes buses to 
be submerged in water to a depth of 18” that damages plywood 
flooring of buses and disrupts the operations at the facility. 

 Heavy Maintenance/Preventive Maintenance Roof Design 

1. The roof project includes investigation of the existing roof framing 
condition for both the Heavy Maintenance and Preventive 
maintenance Buildings by a licensed structural engineer. A final 
report listing deficiencies and recommendations will be provided

to HART for both buildings. We will then proceed into design that 
will include either repair or replacement of the current roof 
system, including gutters, lightning protection, access ladders and 
designated locations to tie off safely for workers who require roof 
access. 

 Equipment Replacement 

1. Several renovations to be completed this fiscal year will include 
the renovation of the restrooms at the Marion Transit Center, 
Replacement of the steam bay lift in the Preventive Maintenance 
buildings, Four sets of portable bus lifts and two air compressors 
for the Heavy Maintenance building.  

6. LABOR ALLOCATION 

The Maintenance Department has the responsibility to ensure that all HART 
facilities are safe, clean, and maintained to standards that ensure employee 
safety and passenger satisfaction. Maintenance has the responsibility to ensure 
that employees are appropriately assigned to shifts that best support daily 
operational needs.

1. PURPOSE 

The mission of the Passenger Amenities and Facility Maintenance Department is 
to provide safe, clean, and reliable facilities and equipment to our patrons and 
employees. The department provides a product and service that primarily 
supports the Maintenance Department. Due to the need for many support 
functions within this industry, other services are provided throughout the agency.  

2. OVERVIEW 

The Passenger Amenities and Facilities Maintenance Department has the 
responsibility of maintaining all equipment and facilities used to continue transit 
service. A large portion of the equipment is used for the repair of transit vehicles, 
such as the bus lifts, fueling and fluid systems, and air compressors are serviced 
by Facility Maintenance personnel. 

In order to meet our goal of providing a high standard of service as efficiently as 
possible this plan has been developed.

 Inspection performed in accordance with manufacturer 
recommendations 

 Inspection types are scheduled and condition-based 
 

B. Corrective-Based 

Corrective repair performed on equipment due to unscheduled mechanical 
failures. 

Strategy 

 Performed by Skilled Labor 

 Performed as a result of reported failure 

3. GOALS  

Goals for maintaining the facilities are based upon the organizational needs and 
service requirements.

maintenance facilities, and several transit centers.  
 

 In addition to the equipment manufacturer’s requirements, facility 
maintenance personnel perform daily visual inspections of safety items.    

 
 Facilities are evaluated to ensure safe and clean environments for patrons 

and employees. Maintenance employees undergo training to update their 
skills to ensure equipment is properly maintained and operational.    

 
 The Department uses performance standards to judge its efficiency and 

effectiveness. The goals are as follows: 
 

1. No equipment damage due to improperly maintained facilities. 

2. No bodily injury to patrons or employees due to a facility defect. 

3. No environmental impacts due to improperly maintained facility   
equipment. 

 
It is our expectation, confirmed by experience that through this maintenance plan 
the Hillsborough Transit Authority will easily meet its performance standards. 
 

4. FACILITY PROFILE 

Facility Maintenance is a branch of the Maintenance Department and consists of 
two separate sections which are responsible for the maintenance of 5 transit 
centers, 1 transfer station, 2 operations facilities, and support systems utilized to 
provide service to our customers.       

 

Facility Maintenance is responsible for maintaining the buildings and grounds of 
HART’s Facility at 21st Avenue, Ybor Administrative and Streetcar Facility, 
Marion Transit Center, Netp@rk Transit Center, University Area Transit Center, 
West Tampa Transit Center, North West Transit Center, Yukon Transfer Center, 
and Marion Street Transitway. Other responsibilities include the monitoring of all 
capital improvement projects and assisting in the creation of project 
specifications.  Maintenance of the facilities, landscaping, lawn service, and 
certain facility upgrades are all cost drivers.  
 
The facilities equipment used in support of the public transit will be maintained at 
a minimum to the specifications of the Operation and Maintenance manual 
provided with the equipment. The Facility Manager will insure that routine 
maintenance and care functions are provided by staff or an outside contractor.

1. This project involves the evaluation and possible replacement of 
the stormwater drainage system for the 21st Avenue bus parking 
lot. The existing drainage system is old and has endured 
significant wear and tear. This has led to failures in the inlets, 
joints and the pipes which results in the erosion of the 
surrounding parking lot subgrade and the deterioration of the 
paved parking lot surface. During periods of heavy rainfall, there 
is significant flooding or pooling of water which causes buses to 
be submerged in water to a depth of 18” that damages plywood 
flooring of buses and disrupts the operations at the facility. 

 Heavy Maintenance/Preventive Maintenance Roof Design 

1. The roof project includes investigation of the existing roof framing 
condition for both the Heavy Maintenance and Preventive 
maintenance Buildings by a licensed structural engineer. A final 
report listing deficiencies and recommendations will be provided 
to HART for both buildings. We will then proceed into design that 
will include either repair or replacement of the current roof 
system, including gutters, lightning protection, access ladders and 
designated locations to tie off safely for workers who require roof 
access. 

 Equipment Replacement 

1. Several renovations to be completed this fiscal year will include 
the renovation of the restrooms at the Marion Transit Center, 
Replacement of the steam bay lift in the Preventive Maintenance 
buildings, Four sets of portable bus lifts and two air compressors 
for the Heavy Maintenance building.  

6. LABOR ALLOCATION 

The Maintenance Department has the responsibility to ensure that all HART 
facilities are safe, clean, and maintained to standards that ensure employee 
safety and passenger satisfaction. Maintenance has the responsibility to ensure 
that employees are appropriately assigned to shifts that best support daily 
operational needs.

1.0 SCOPE 

This SOP applies to the scheduling of APC equipped revenue vehicles to provide 
system wide ridership data on a recurring, regular basis. This SOP affects the 
Operations and Maintenance Departments. There are currently 72 HART 
vehicles equipped with APC’s representing over a third of the various fleets. 
Taking into account spare ratios, interlocking routes, and other unknowns, it is 
the intent of this SOP to establish a threshold of data collection for all routes 
every month. The weekday data will be collected from start of business on 
Monday through Friday night. Weekend runs will be tracked from the period not 
collected during the weekday process. This SOP intends to provide data for 7 
continuous days, 24 hours per day. 

2.0 PURPOSE 

The purpose of this SOP is to provide current and accurate ridership data.  This 
information will be linked through GIS to a company-wide data base for all to 
users to access.

7.0 PROCEDURE 

A. Data will be collected from every route at least once per mark-up. 

B. Data will be collected on each route continuously for seven days. 

1. Assign APC equipped vehicles to ensure complete route coverage 
continuously for a 7 day period.   

7.1 Determine which routes will use APC equipped vehicles 

A. Consider interlining routes so we can get data from several routes 
using the same vehicle(s).   

B. All vehicles on the route for the 7 day study time period will be APC 
equipped. 

 

NOTE: 

When the route data has been collected for the week, the APC data will be 
exported from Business Objects to an Excel format. The Excel file will then 
be imported into the GIS database for analysis and mapping purposes in 

the GIS system.

information to the Manager / Assistant Manager of Vehicle 
Maintenance for corrective action. 

B. Utilizing the previous Work Orders to assist in proper diagnosis 
and repair of the failure. 

7.3 Third-time Failures  

Any vehicle that has been Roadcalled three (3) times within thirty days 
for the same vehicle system failure will remain out of service until the 
Manager/ Assistant Manager of Vehicle Maintenance has determined 
that it has been properly repaired.

1.0 SCOPE 

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) pertains to all HART personnel 
performing work that utilizes operation of powered industrial trucks. 

2.0 PURPOSE 

This SOP establishes safety requirements relating to fire protection, design, 
maintenance and use of fork trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, scissor lifts, and 
other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or internal 
combustion engines. This SOP DOES NOT apply to compressed air or 
nonflammable compressed gas operated industrial trucks. 

3.0 DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS 

HART Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority 

ABC 

Fire extinguishers are divided into three categories, based on 
different types of fires: 

Class A Extinguishers are for ordinary combustible 
materials such as paper, wood, cardboard, and 
most plastics. The numerical rating on these types 
of extinguishers indicates the amount of water it 
holds and the amount of fire it can extinguish.  

Class B Fires involve flammable or combustible liquids 
such as gasoline, kerosene, grease and oil. The 
numerical rating for class B extinguishers 
indicates the approximate number of square feet 
of fire it can extinguish.  

Class C Fires involve electrical equipment, such as 
appliances, wiring, circuit breakers and outlets. 
Never use water to extinguish class C fires - the 
risk of electrical shock is far too great! Class C 
extinguishers do not have a numerical rating. The 
C classification means the extinguishing agent is 
non-conductive. 

ANSI American National Standards Institute. 

Approved 
Industrial 

Trucks 

Industrial trucks that are in compliance with design and 
construction requirements set forth in “American National 
Standard for Powered Industrial Trucks”, Part II, ANSI B56-1-
1969; which is incorporated by reference as specified in OSHA 
1910.6. Approved trucks shall bear a label or some other 
identifying mark indicating approval by a nationally recognized 
testing laboratory.

1. SCOPE 

A completed contract is one that is both physically and administratively complete. 
A contract is physically complete only after all deliverable items and services 
called for under the contract have been delivered and accepted by HART. These 
deliverable items include such things as reports, spare parts, warranty 
documents, and proof of insurance (where required by the contract terms). These 
deliverable items may or may not have been priced as discrete pay items in the 
contract, but they are required deliverables, and the contract is not physically 
complete until all deliverables are made. A contract is administratively complete 
when all payments have been made and all administrative actions accomplished. 
The steps that must be completed to close out a contract will depend upon the 
type and/or nature of the contract. 

 
2. PURPOSE 

The purpose of this SOP is to ensure that all aspects of the Project Closeout 
process is followed regarding the receipt of required documents and monitoring 
of federal funding requirements prior to final payment being authorized.

7.0 PROCEDURE 

 The East Parking Lot Repaving project will be accomplished in phases to 
mitigate disruption of daily operations as much as possible. Each phase is 
expected to last 10 to 14 days. Lot configuration maps and vehicle parking space 
assignment lists will be posted in maintenance and operations areas for 
accessibility to all HART personnel tasked with operating, maintaining, servicing 
and cleaning of vehicles.   

 During each phase of this project that requires an operator to back a bus out of 
its assigned parking spot to initiate its assigned route, Operations management 
has determined that a Dispatcher/Supervisor will be on hand to assist with the 
safe backing procedure.

7.0 PROCEDURE 

The methane detection system is equipped with colored strobes and horns 
located inside and outside the fuel lane, heavy maintenance (HM), and 
preventive maintenance (PM) buildings. These strobes signify the condition of 
the air relative to the methane concentrations within a coverage area. The strobe 
colors are green, amber, and red. The green strobe indicates a normal condition. 
The amber strobe signifies the system is at 25% lower flammability level (LFL). 
And the red strobe designates the system is at 50% lower flammability level 
(LFL).  

The activation of the amber strobe light indicates the methane detection system 
has detected a compressed natural gas (CNG) leak of at least 25% LFL. The 
activation of the red strobe light indicates the methane detection system has 
detected a CNG leak of at least 50% LFL. Either of these events will initiate the 
warning horns signifying a mandatory evacuation of all occupants of the affected 
building. Upon activation of this alarm, all occupants in the following locations 
shall evacuate the building through a marked exit door or an open garage bay 
door and proceed to their designated evacuation point indicated below to await 
further instruction from a supervisor. In the instance that all garage bay doors are 
shut, do not attempt to open the garage bay doors. Proceed to a marked exit 
door. 

A. HM Bldg. – Occupants adjacent to the east bays (including stores radio 
shop) shall evacuate and gather at the DACCO gate. Occupants adjacent 
to the west bays and second floor offices shall evacuate and gather in the 
staff parking lot near the employee turnstile.  

B. PM Bldg. – Occupants shall evacuate and gather at the “J – island” in the 
bus parking area.  

7.1 Supervisors 

A. Perform a head count of all on-duty personnel at the evacuation point. 
Contact dispatch once you have safely evacuated the building to inform 
them of the building evacuation.   

B. The supervisor shall designate an employee to stand at the main entrance 
(21st street) to direct the emergency responders to the appropriate 
building.

7.2 Strobe Activation 

A. The amber strobe activation (25% FLF) will automatically shut off the gas 
supply valve and heaters. The amber strobe may automatically reset once 
the system detects a normal condition. Re-occupation of the building may 
not occur until the green strobe has re-activated. 

B. The red strobe activation (50% LFL) will automatically shut off the gas 
supply valve, heaters, and shunt trip existing electrical circuit breakers. 
The red strobe will not automatically reset. It shall be manually reset by 
the proper/ designated personnel. Re-entry shall not occur until the 
system has been reset and the green strobe has re-activated.

twelve months. 

E. There must be no more than 3 missouts and/or 3 absence

exemplary work.  The maintenance employee of the month 
selection must be jointly approved by the Director of Maintenance 
and the Fleet and Facility Managers.

seniority. 

I. The winner receives a $100 check, a day off with pay, a plaque and 
a dedicated maintenance employee of the month parking spot.  

J. The employee is also recognized at employee of the month 
recognition meetings held during a HART Board meeting but the
